At a small dance studio in Reykjavík drummers and dancers from Guinea, West-Africa teach Icelandic women to move to the rhythm and dance of the rich African culture they have left behind, in search of a better life in the Western world. But what is a better life? The young generation of Guineans or Africans all dream of moving to the west.
