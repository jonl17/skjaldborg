Through the documentary The Arctic Circus, we experience the different personalities of the circus group, the society they travel through and the incredible landscapes. We enter a circus that through its performances tries to modernize and change the perception of the traditional circus. This is a portrait of a group of people who live by bringing joy to others, and with a desire to build a cultural understanding of circus as a great art form.
