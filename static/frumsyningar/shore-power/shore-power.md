Skemmtiferðaskip kemur til hafnar á Seyðisfirði með sex sinnum fleiri farþega en búa í bænum og fjórum sinnum hærra en nokkurt mannvirki á staðnum.

An Icelandic guide who has worked since his teenage years in the 1990’s voices the changes and challenges that have come to Iceland with this new wave of mass tourism.
